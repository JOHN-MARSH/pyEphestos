# SUMMARY 
Ephestus is visual programming language that can import and export python code and is fully compliant with python. It is meant to make 
programming more visual and easier for the user , especially the creation of Blender addons. 


There are going to be 3 tools:

## 1) Morpheas 

A port of Morphic Gui for python . Morphic is the standard GUI for Squeak, Pharo and Self programming languages and is unique in essense
that besides user interaction it allows the user to even modify it while a programm is running make it possible to create ease custom modifications.
Also any piece of code can have a visual representation called morph, thus making it suitable for visual programming.
 
## 2) Proteas 

Visual Programming Environement leveraging Morpheas and Real Time Context Sensitive Documentation. Proteas goal is to be fully complaint 
with python allowin any python programm to be a proteas programm and vice versa. Any piece of code will display documentation so the user never feels 
lost. 

## 3) Orpheas 

DAW front end for Supercollider music and audio synthesis server via OSC messages

Currently only Morpheas is implemented , based on pymorphic by Jens Monig. The goal for the time being is to offer to blender developers a second GUI 
that will run on top of bgl and be able to be more flexible , more powerful and more customisable then the standard Blender GUI making it possible to 
design any kind of graphical element that will allow or not allow user interaction. 

Its my intention to also create a standalone version that will be not dependant and related to blender but used for general python developement.
