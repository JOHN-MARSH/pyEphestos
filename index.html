        <h3>Welcome to Ephestos</h3>

<p>"Ephestos" is a visual programming environmet for python similar to an IDE but with some fundamental diffirences. Ephestos uses its own GUI called "Morpheas" a very modular gui that not only is capable of offering a graphical user interface to the user, that interface is easily customisable by the user , made solely from small blocks called "morphs", with no required coding. Also the code is edited visually using morphs again to further help the user. For now the project is still in its infancy with many feature to implement , but is however a usable Blender addon that is constantly developed. Using any of the above button you can download the source or visit the repository at github. </p>

<p>Installation is very easy just unzip the Ephestos folder, drop it in your Blender addons folder , activate in the addons browsers and then go to 3d View window and click on the Ephestos button.</p>

<h3>Morpheas Age</h3>

<p> In this time period the main focus is the implementation of Morpheus in a way that can be highly usable from the user and modifiable with zero to minimum coding. Ease of use and open architecture is the main goals. Morpheas is made up from smaller blocks called morphs that the user can customise but also assemble together via embeding for building more complex sophisticated morphs.Essentially a morph is a GUI element and of course a python object but it can also be far more than that like any python object. The goal is to make morphs embedable inside other morphs thus making it simple and easy to create complex and sophisticated morphs with assembling many simpler ones. Modularity  and ease of use are the main goals. Morpheas is planed to take 3 years into the making and is still in year one with almost 2000 lines of code already at its disposal. Already we have implemented the basic morph class that is the mother of all morph classes, hand morph that handles all mouse interaction and point / rectangle / frame classes each one handling points , rectangles and parenting elements. Parenting is an essential bart to embeding morphs as not only one morph can be inside another moph it can have parent / child relationships with other morph thus capable creating hierarchy trees that offer a more uniform control of all the morphs inside another morph and capable of creating complex relationships that are easy to control.  </p>

<h3>Proteas Age</h3>

<p>In this age , the main focus shifts to the visual coding part itself, Proteas uses Morpheas to represent code statements visualy similar to other visual programming environments / languages like Scratch . The aim is to automate many of the repetitive task the coder comes against and make code much easier to understand and read. Proteas will also offer context sensitive real time documentation that will be always around to help users through learning python and the Blender Python API and of course Ephestos itself.</p>

<h3>Orpheas Age</h3>
<p>This age is dedicated to music and sound generation. Orpheus is a GUI frontend for Supercollider engine. Supercollider is a extremely powerful audio and music engine that Ephestos will control through Orpheas which of course will once more use Morpheas. The goal is to create an environment that the user can use for performing any musical and sound task. Orpheas is the last age and therefor will concetrate on this only when the previous ages have ended </p>
