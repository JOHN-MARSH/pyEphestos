        <h3>Welcome to Ephestos</h3>

<p>"Ephestos" is a visual programming environmet for python similar to an IDE but with some fundamental diffirences. Ephestos uses its own GUI called "Morpheas" a very modular gui that not only is capable of offering a graphical user interface that interface is easily customisable to the user , made solely from small block called "morphs, with no required coding. Also the code is edited visually using morphs again to further help the user. For now the project is still in its infancy with many feature to implement , but is however a usable Blender addon that is constantly developed.  </p>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Morpheas Age</h3>

<p> In this time period the main focus is the implementation of Morpheus in a way that can be highly usable from the user and modifiable with zero to minimum coding. Ease of use and open architecture is the main goals. Morpheas is made up from smaller blocks called morphs that the user can customise but also assemble together via embeding for building more complex sophisticated morphs. </p>

<h3>Proteas Age</h3>

<p>In this age , the main focus shifts to the visual coding part itself, Proteas uses Morpheas to represent code statement visualy similar to other visual programming environments / languages like Scratch . The aim is to automate many of the repetitive task the coder comes against and make code much easier to understand and read. Proteas will also offer context sensitive real time documentation that will be always around to help users through learning python and the Blender Python API and of course Ephestos itself.</p>

<h3>Orpheas Age</h3>
<p>This age is dedicated to music and sound generation. Orpheus is a GUI frontend for Supercollider engine. Supercollider is a extremely powerful audio and music engine that Ephestos will control through Orpheas which of course will once more use Morpheas. The goal is to create an environment that the user can use for performing any musical and sound task. Orpheas is the last age and therefor will concetrate on this only when the previous ages have ended </p>
