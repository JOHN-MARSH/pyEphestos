# SUMMARY

Ephestos is an exploration of GUI design and visual coding ideas I have. My goals is to create a visual coding enviroment based on smalltalk that will allow anhyone to code and learn how to code with ease, graphics and sound.


There are going to be 3 tools:

1) Morpheas - A port of Morphic Gui for python. Morphic is the standard GUI for Squeak, Pharo and Self programming languages and is unique in the sense that besides user interaction it allows the user to even modify it while a programm is running make it possible to create ease custom modifications. Also any piece of code can have a visual representation called morph, thus making it suitable for visual programming.

2) Proteas - Visual Programming Environement leveraging Morpheas and Real Time Context Sensitive Documentation. Proteas' goal is to be fully complaint with python allowing any python program to be a proteas programm and vice versa. Any piece of code will display documentation so the user never feels lost.

3) Orpheas - DAW front end for Supercollider music and audio synthesis server via OSC messages.

The projest started as a blender addon based on pymorphic by Jens Monig. However now Ephestos is developed as a product by itself , still related to blender but no longer dependant on it . Instead now Ephestos targets web technologies like hmtl 5, css, javascript , webgl , canvas etc.
